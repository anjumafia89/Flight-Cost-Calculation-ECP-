I have used the QASE tool to create test cases and imported CSV files. Black Box Testing (ECP) is utilized for creating the test cases.

These are the requirements:

Flat rate for flights less than 500 miles = $100

1. calculate cost based on distance and departure date for flights between 500 and 1000 miles
   
    1. 10 cents per mile if departing within 7 days
    2. 8 cents per mile if departing within 30 days
    3. 6 cents per mile if departing within 90 days
3. calculate cost based on distance, departure date, and service class for flights over 1000 miles
   
   1. 30 cents per mile if departing within 7 days
   2. 25 cents per mile if departing within 30 days
   3. 20 cents per mile if departing within 90 days.
      
5. Seat Class
   1. fare not change for Economy class
   2. double the cost for Business class
   3. triple the cost for First class.
